Code style rules:
- Python 3.8+ only; no external dependencies
- Minimal diffs; do not reformat or rename unrelated code
- Type hints on public functions/classes; explicit imports (no wildcards)
- Black-compatible formatting; MyPy-friendly typing
- Naming: snake_case (functions/variables), PascalCase (classes), UPPER_SNAKE (constants)
- Functions small; extract helpers when >40 lines; avoid global state
- Pure logic in engines; side effects only in GUI
- No prints in libraries; use existing logging/GUI log methods
- Cross-platform paths; prefer pathlib; Windows-friendly
- Preserve GUI layout contracts (stacked sections, responsive canvas) and event bindings
- Keep JSON save format stable (keys unchanged)

Message style rules:
- Commit/PR titles: imperative, <=72 chars; wrap bodies at 72
- Logs/status: short, factual, no emojis; consistent punctuation
- Errors: actionable, include offending value/context
- UI labels: Title Case; other user text: sentence case; no fluff

Folder/structure rules:
- GUI in gui.py; Conway engine in automaton.py; HexiDirect in hex_rules.py
- Tests under tests/ named test_*.py
- Docs at repo root; *.md for docs; *.txt for strict rule lists
- Scripts/tools at repo root; avoid new top-level folders without need
- Filenames lowercase_with_underscores.py
- Chat responses (if any): short, impersonal, no emojis, no fluff
